# FeatureCloud tutorial

This repository provides example apps for [developing federated applications in FeatureCloud](https://medium.com/developing-federated-applications-in-featurecloud)

All the example apps use same files for dockerization. Also, for all apps default requirements will be used.  
Example apps are implemented in the tutorial package where each is linked to one of our medium stories.
For those apps that has different requirements there are files in their package that should be replaced with the
counterparts in the root directory.
